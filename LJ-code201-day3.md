# daily-learning-journals

It was good day, I think I got to understand 50% of the class. There are several thing I have better view then before:

- First thing first .md file creation and meanning
- js part 2 
                - data type
                - splitting string by using a specific charector 
                - reverse split string (str_array.join(' '))
-codepen.io and repl.it  looks good.
-margin padding starts to make sence.
-Loop and array.

I am interested for whiteboarding and freelance in future.
I do not understand SSH.

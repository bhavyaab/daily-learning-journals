# daily-learning-journals day 4


One more good day of learning code, I think I got to understand 80% of the class today. There are several thing I have better view then before:

- array definig  as empty array, I was not clear to me. 
- functions, string slice.
- Positioning was awesome it makes more sance now but yes parctic practice need. "a ha!" moment were
-                absolute and relative position
                 floats
                 targeting specific file without assigning class

- pair programming was good, lets do it again..
-                      -good for learning to use technical syntax
-                      -good to practice for speekinging your mind out loud.
- git is again had his issue but went out of it ok.
